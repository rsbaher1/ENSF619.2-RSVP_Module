# CONTRIBUTING
 

**GOAL:** Wedding/Event RSVP module that could be easily added to modern websites. NextJS is growing in popularity among web developers, and since it is based off NodeJS and ReactJS, this module will be created using NodeJS.  


## Hard Features  

### Must Haves:  
1. User can create Events.  
2. User can create and edit guest list and sub-groups for each event.  
   *Sub-group examples: bridesmaids, groomsmen, and Bridal Party which includes bridesmaids and groomsmen*  
3.	User can schedule emails to be sent to all guests or select groups (Ex. Bridal party, or guests that did not respond).  
      -  Emails can be updated/edited only before it is sent.  
4.	User can view and edit Guestâ€™s responses for all events or select events.  
   *The responses would be: Attending, not attending, or No response.*  
5. User can add meal options to RSVP invitation.  
5.	Guests are only able to view events they are invited to.  
6. Guests are only able to select their RSVP response for the events they were invited to and for others on their invitation.  
   *For instance: a couple with children are all individual guests but placed on the same invitation. Either parent can RSVP for their own family but not another guest invited to the event.*  
7.	Guests have the ability to update their responses at anytime before the RSVP deadline.  

### Nice-to-Haves:  
1.	User can create and edit multiple events with different groups of guests or all guests.  
   For example, a Bachelorette party for Bridesmaids, Henna Party for all guests, and Wedding Reception for all guests.  
2.	Guests are able to opt-in to receive email reminders for RSVP deadlines.  
3. Google Photos integration: Each event has a google photos album where the user (event creator) and guests could upload and view photos taken at the event. The album should be created on the user's google account.  


## Soft Features  

- **Maintainable**: The module is designed to ease the process of adding features and bug. It should be easy for contributors to understand and work on it.  
- **User-Friendly**: The module is created with the user experience in mind. All important functionalities must be easy to find and understand by the user.  
- **Secure**: The module should be secure from online threats and only Users should have the ability to create events and guest lists, and only Guests should have the ability to send RSVP responses to events they are invited to. Guests cannot create or edit events nor guest lists for events.
